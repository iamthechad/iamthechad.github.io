_This post was originally part of a series documenting an open source web framework I worked on. The framework is well and dead, but Iâ€™m keeping these posts for posterity._

Version 1.3 of Frame2 is officially available. The framework can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/iamthechad/frame2), and the sample applications are available [here](https://github.com/iamthechad/frame2/tree/master/Frame2/samples).

Work on the Eclipse plugin continues, with a (hopeful) release date in the next week or two.
